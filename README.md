# Tech Blog

## Description

I was tasked with making a cms-style blog site. There had to be a homepage with a login/sign up form and some existing blog posts. There had to be navigation links and a dashboard. There also needed to be a way to create a blog post if you are logged in and comment showing the users day and when they commented. If you are idle for longer than a certain amount of time it also has to log the user out.
